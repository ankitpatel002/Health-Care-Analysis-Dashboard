Cholesterol
Stroke
Visualizations:

Donut Charts:

Percentage of Total Patients by Health Status
Percentage of Total Patients by Habits
Stacked Bar Charts:
Total Patients by Weight Category (Not Overweight, Overweight)
Health Risk by Age Group
Line Charts:

This dashboard not only highlights key health indicators but also allows for detailed analysis through various filters and visualizations. Whether you're looking at the prevalence of heart attacks, analyzing patient habits, or assessing health risks across different age groups and occupations, this tool offers a clear and interactive way to explore the data.

I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive better health outcomes, and this project is a testament to that. You can view the interactive dashboard.

I look forward to your feedback and suggestions. Let's work together to turn data into actionable insights!
